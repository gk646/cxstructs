## Datastructures and Algorithms Collection in C++


A small (but growing) header only collection of selected datastructures and algorithms. 
This collection is primarily for educational purposes as the implementations are easy to read and understand.

All implementations in the include folder  are however tested and can be used in projects.

**Notes:**
- Each header is self contained, no cross dependencies.
- Comparisons with STL counterparts can be run using the Comparison.h header
- Only use the **include** dir for importing headers (includes only finished and tested ones)
