## Datastructures and Algorithms Collection in C++


A small (but growing) header only collection of selected datastructures and algorithms. 
This collection is primarily built for educational purposes as the implementations are easy to read and well documented.

To use these, simply include the **include directory**, which contains only finalized and tested headers.

**Features**

- Each algorithm comes with a runtime description and a documentation of the underlying principle
- The data structures have fully documented methods, adhering to a consistent calling syntax for ease of use
- Each header is self-contained without any cross dependencies.
- Comparisons with STL counterparts can be run using the Comparison.h header
